# Step by step Guide
## Starting point

**WARNING**


If you're already familiar with git, virtual evnirorments and jupiter notebooks or you're not interested in it you should jump this guide.


**WARNING 2**


This guide is based on Linux systems. If you are using Windows something could be different. Anyway I'll try to insert refernces to the offical guides of the various tools used, so you can check the correct execution for your OS.


### Download the repository


As well explained in the appostie page: [https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)	
To dowload the repository you can open a terminal and use:
> git clone git@github.com:BeeNick/ML_Exercises.git



### Programming lenguages

#### Python - (python3)

Most Linux distributions came with python preinstalled, here the official page: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)



### Set up a virtual envirorment


The exercises will be mainly in python, could be usefull set up an isolated envirorment to avoid conflicts with components of others projects wich can reqire different library versions.

To do so with python we can use virtualenv, to install virtualenv for your user you can type in the terminal:
> python3 -m pip install --user -U virtualenv

And create an isolated python envirorment with:
> python3 -m virtualenv mle_env

(where *mle_env* is the name of the new envirorment so choose wath you want)

Use:
> source mle_env/bin/activate

to activate the envirorment.

While the envirorment is active any pachkage you install with *pip* will be installed in this isolated envriromrent.
Use:
> deactivate

to deactivate the envirorment.

Here the offical page: [https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)



### Create a gitignore to avoid tracing of virtual envirorment


To avoid tracing of virtual envirorment files you can create a *.gitignore* file and write in it the name of your virtual enviorment (that coincides with the related folder). 



### Jupiter notebook / IPython notebook


For our interest in this repository, the Jupiter (or IPython) notebook are essentially a way to simplify the report drafting for information generated by code exectution and make a sherable cool documented code.

Here the official page: [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/)


To install jupiter notebook use:
> python3 -m pip install -U notebook

To set up an apposite kernel for the notebook in the virtualenv:
> python3 -m ipykernel instal --user --name=mle_p3

To run the notebook use:
> jupyter notebook


Then you should set *gitignore* to ignore hidden directories:
>.*

>!/.gitignore



I suggest to install also *jupyterthemes* to change the defautl theme with the one wich you are more comfortable with.
> python3 -m pip install -U jupyterthemes

Show the available themes:
> jt -l

Set a theme:
> jt -t *themename*
